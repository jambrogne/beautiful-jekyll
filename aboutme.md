### About this Blog

Welcome to The Nav Pane - a site whose title hopefully evokes my professional interests: technical writing (as in Microsoft Word's navigation pane) and aviation (whose practitioners do a lot of navigating).

Some good personal blogs start with an end in sight. ([Here’s one example](http://futureairlinepilot.blogspot.com/).) I don’t know where mine will take me. Perhaps I’ll write a book, or start a company, or wake up one day and realize my dream is to run a crêpe food truck. Nah...

What I do know is that *this* technical writing blog is focused on the Washington, D.C. area’s unique and essential aerospace industry. The region is an exciting hub of opportunities for flight enthusiasts who write the docs. But for reasons I don't fully understand, we seem to do things a little differently here than they do out West with their docs-as-code workflows.

By writing in this blog, I have two goals. 

1. I want to strengthen my domain expertise, building upon my knowledge of flight operations and air-traffic management systems as well as sharpening my critical eye for aerospace industry news.
2. With the explosion of remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities to serve D.C.'s aerospace industry are open to the world. If you want to write or edit tech pubs, develop software, or report the news in support of the U.S. flying public, I want to help you. 

Whether or not you live with me here in the “Silicon Valley of the East,” welcome to my blog. I truly hope your stay is worth it.
